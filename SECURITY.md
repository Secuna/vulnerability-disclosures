# Secuna's Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
Secuna may occasionally discover security vulnerabilities in open-source projects and in products from other companies that have a vulnerability disclosure policy in place. In such cases, our primary objective is to ensure the prompt resolution of these vulnerabilities, all the while ensuring that those affected are promptly informed. This allows them to safeguard their systems by applying a patch or updating their software.

Secuna will promptly contact the responsible third party and inform them of any security vulnerability we discover. We expect the third party to respond within 30 days, providing details on how they plan to mitigate the issue and protect affected individuals. If we do not receive a response within this 30-day period after responsibly disclosing the vulnerability, Secuna reserves the right to disclose the security vulnerability.

Furthermore, if, after 90 days of reporting and collaborating with the third party, there is no indication of a fix or update addressing the issue in a reasonable manner, Secuna will disclose the security vulnerability.

However, we will strive to follow the recommended vulnerability disclosure steps and proposed timelines whenever possible. Yet, we acknowledge that there may be scenarios where deviations are necessary. If Secuna determines that disclosing a security vulnerability earlier would serve the greater benefit of the public or potentially impacted individuals, we reserve the right to do so.

## Reporting
- Secuna will make reasonable efforts to locate the correct contact details for reporting a vulnerability. We will take necessary steps to securely establish communication with them. This may involve using various contact methods, including but not limited to sending emails to security reporting addresses (e.g., security@company.tld), filing bugs in bug trackers without sensitive or confidential information, utilizing contact forms, or submitting support tickets.
- The contacted party should promptly acknowledge the report and confirm whether we have provided sufficient information to comprehend the reported issue.
- In our report, Secuna will include a comprehensive description of the discovered issue, a link to Secuna's responsible vulnerability disclosure policy, and an outline of the expected next steps.
- If necessary, Secuna will furnish additional information to assist the contact in replicating the identified vulnerability.
- If no response is received within 30 days from the contact acknowledging the security vulnerability report, we will assume that no action is being taken. In such cases, we reserve the right to disclose the issue.
- For disclosure timeframe purposes, Secuna's submission of the report marks the beginning of the process.
- Secuna typically does not enter into non-disclosure agreements specific to individual security vulnerabilities that we have reported.

## Mitigation & Timeline
- When necessary, Secuna will collaborate with the third party to determine the nature of the vulnerability and potential fixes. We will share relevant technical details to expedite the resolution.
- The contact should maintain transparency regarding the progress of mitigation. They are expected to make reasonable efforts to address the reported vulnerability within 90 days and provide updates to Secuna within the specified timeline.
- Secuna will coordinate the disclosure with the availability or rollout of the fix.
- If no solution is provided by the 90-day deadline, we will notify the contact of our intent to disclose the reported vulnerability.
- In the absence of mitigating circumstances, we will disclose the vulnerability as soon as reasonably possible.

## Disclosure
- Depending on the nature of the issue, there may be multiple paths for disclosure: (1) public disclosure, (2) direct disclosure to users of the product/project, or (3) an initial limited disclosure followed by a full disclosure. Secuna will collaborate with the third party to determine the most suitable approach in each case.
- Our objective is to disclose vulnerabilities in a manner that is most beneficial to the community. For instance, we may provide guidance on workarounds, methods for verifying the implementation of patches, and other information to assist individuals in containing or resolving the issue.
- We may opt to include a timeline to document communication and remediation efforts undertaken by both Secuna and the third party. When feasible, our disclosure will also incorporate recommended steps for mitigating the issue.
- We will include a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier when available, and if necessary, we will issue an appropriate CVE.
- If the bug is actively being exploited in the wild and disclosing the vulnerability would provide better protection for individuals than not disclosing the issue.
- Secuna will assess each issue individually, considering our assessment of the risk to individuals.
- We will make every effort to apply this policy consistently.

This policy refers to what Secuna does when we find an issue in third party code.
